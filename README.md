# OIDM Use Cases
This repository will be used to collect and document ideas for use cases for the Open Imaging Data Model project.

1. How to define use cases
  - What information should be captured as part of a use case?
  - Do we want a text (Markdown) or data-based format (JSON)?
2. How to catalog use cases
  - This repository to start 
3. Categories of use cases
  - Workflow/list oriented
  - AI pipeline oriented
  - Reporting oriented
  - Image-viewer oriented
  - Data exploration/outcome oriented
  - Multi-category

This document will be used to describe our thoughts on how to develop use cases. So far, the idea we have
is that we'll use an index file [Index.md](Index.md) for people to just list ideas that they've had but haven't
attached any additional details for (maybe include a brief, one-sentence description). When ideas want to become
more formal, we'll be defining appropriate metadata to be associated with each case, and document those cases
in files organized hierarchy (as JSON or Markdown) in this repository.
